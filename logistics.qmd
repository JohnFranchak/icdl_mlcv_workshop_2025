## Registration

All attendees (including presenters) must register for the workshop on the ICDL conference [site](https://icdl2025.fel.cvut.cz/registration/). The registration for the workshop day is a separate fee than the main conference registration. 

## Poster Submissions

Poster submissions are encouraged and will be accepted until August 26. Please indicate your interest [here](https://forms.gle/UKxeYWYwAzEa95Eu7). The goal of the poster session is to showcase research related to using machine learning and wearable or environmental sensing technology to study early childhood behavior, environments, and learning. The poster session will be approximately 1.5 hours and provide an opportunity to discuss work with an interdisciplinary audience interested in developmental psychology, machine learning, and robotics. Attendees are welcome to present a poster that will also appear in the main conference as long as it fits the topic.
