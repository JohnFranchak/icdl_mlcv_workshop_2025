    "text": "The workshop “Machine Learning for Tracking Early Behavior and Environments” will take place on September 16, 2025 as part of the IEEE International Conference on Learning and Development in Prague, Czechia. Drawing 15 speakers with interdisciplinary expertise, the workshop will disseminate cutting-edge applications of machine learning methods in infancy research that span a wide range of topics—perception, sleep, movement, language, emotion, and social interaction.\nThe organizers, Sam Wass, John Franchak, and Melina Knabe, invite you to join for the day-long program by registering on the ICDL conference site. A morning poster session will provide an opportunity for attendees to discuss ongoing projects. The logistics page has more details about conference registration and poster submissions."

Drawing 15 internationally-recognized speakers with interdisciplinary expertise, we will present three talk sessions that demonstrate how researchers use machine learning to assess what infants do (Session 1), what they experience (Session 2), and what they learn (Session 3). In addition, a morning poster session will provide an opportunity for attendees to discuss ongoing projects. The workshop organizers will solicit poster submissions from workshop attendees in advance."
